# Laptop Price Prediction System

## Project Overview

The **Laptop Price Prediction System** is a machine learning-based project aimed at predicting the price of laptops using various specifications such as the brand (company), type, screen size, resolution, CPU type, RAM, memory, GPU, operating system, and weight. This system uses **supervised learning** techniques, specifically **regression models**, to estimate laptop prices from given input features.

The project leverages the power of **Python**, **scikit-learn** for machine learning, **pandas** for data manipulation, and **matplotlib** for visualizing the data. It is an excellent starting point for understanding how regression algorithms can be applied to real-world problems like price prediction.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned by handling missing values, encoding categorical features (like the brand and type), and scaling numerical features (like RAM and CPU speed) to prepare it for machine learning.
  
- **Supervised Learning**: This project uses **regression models** such as **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** to predict laptop prices based on the input features. Regression is a supervised learning technique, where the model is trained on labeled data to predict continuous outcomes.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Several machine learning models are trained using the dataset, and their performance is evaluated using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **R-squared (R²)**.

- **Prediction Interface**: The trained models can be used to predict laptop prices based on user input in a structured format. 

- **Visualization**: Plots and graphs are used to better understand the relationship between laptop features and their prices, and to compare model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models like Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization (graphs, plots).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and documenting the code in an interactive environment.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

You can also install the necessary libraries from the `requirements.txt` file (if included) using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

Follow the steps below to run the **Laptop Price Prediction** project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptop-price-predictor.git
   cd laptop-price-predictor
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open the `laptop_price_prediction.ipynb` file and execute the cells to run the entire analysis and predictions.

3. **Run the Python Script**:
   Alternatively, you can run the `laptop_price_prediction.py` script directly if you prefer not to use Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   python laptop_price_prediction.py
   ```

   This script will automatically load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and output the predicted prices.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of laptops, which includes various features such as:

- **Company**: The brand name of the laptop (e.g., Apple, Dell, HP).
- **Type**: The type of laptop (e.g., Ultrabook, Gaming).
- **Inches**: The screen size in inches.
- **ScreenResolution**: The resolution of the screen.
- **Cpu**: The processor details (e.g., Intel i5, i7).
- **Ram**: Amount of RAM in GB.
- **Memory**: Storage capacity (e.g., 512GB SSD, 1TB HDD).
- **Gpu**: Graphics processing unit (e.g., Nvidia GTX).
- **OpSys**: The operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS).
- **Weight**: Weight of the laptop in kg.
- **Price**: The target variable, the price of the laptop.

You can access the dataset in the file `laptop_data.csv`, which should be located in the root directory of the project.

## Model Description

The core objective of the project is to predict the **price** of a laptop using its **specifications**. To achieve this, we apply **supervised learning**:

1. **Supervised Learning**:
   - In supervised learning, the model is trained on **labeled data**, meaning both the input features and the target variable (price) are provided. The model learns the relationship between the inputs and outputs.
   - For our case, the task is **regression**, where the goal is to predict a continuous output (the price of the laptop) based on various input features.

2. **Model Training**:
   - We train the machine learning model using the **laptop_data.csv** dataset, which contains the features of various laptops and their corresponding prices.
   - Multiple regression models such as **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regression** are trained and evaluated.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - After training the models, we evaluate their performance using common metrics:
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.
     - **R-squared (R²)**: Indicates how well the model fits the data. A value closer to 1 indicates a better fit.

## Key Concepts in Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**:
   - In **supervised learning**, the algorithm is trained on a dataset that includes both the **input features** (laptop specifications) and the **output labels** (prices). The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.
   - **Regression**: A form of supervised learning used for predicting continuous values, such as predicting the price of a laptop.

2. **Training and Testing Data**:
   - **Training Data**: This is the data used to train the model, where the algorithm learns the relationship between features and labels.
   - **Testing Data**: This is a separate set of data that is used to evaluate the model's performance after training.

3. **Overfitting and Underfitting**:
   - **Overfitting**: Occurs when the model is too complex and learns not only the true patterns in the data but also the noise, leading to poor generalization to new data.
   - **Underfitting**: Occurs when the model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and testing data.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
   - **R-squared (R²)**: A measure of how well the model explains the variation in the target variable. A value closer to 1 indicates a better fit.
